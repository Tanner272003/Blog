We stay at Barb Treadway\u2019s house in tents on her lawn.\u00a0 Without Barb the weekend would not be possible to afford to do.\u00a0 She really is a super generous person and has become a great friend that I look forward to skiing with and climbing with more this year.</p><br /><p>It really is pretty amazing to see the things that people can overcome in order to do the things they love.\u00a0 It is also cool that no one in the group cares that everyone is overcoming something we are just friends hanging out and doing something fun.\u00a0 We cheer each other on just like any group of athletes would who are achieving their goals they have set.\u00a0 When you are up on the wall no one knows you have any disability you are then just another climber working your way to the top.</p><br /><p>I chose to work on my systems for my future ascent of El Capitan and try out some mechanical advantage ideas.\u00a0 It was really helpful to be in a group of people that made it their sole purpose to help all the athletes out during the weekend.\u00a0 I had Gary Dunn and Craig Muderlak coming up with ideas to try and Will Savage on belay. I also had my girlfriend Sandy there to take pictures for me. I am sure it wasn\u2019t easy to stand around and watch for 2 days. I am really glad she went and we got to spend that time together. They all really went out of their way to help me figure things out and in the end we actually decided for now at least that having no mechanical advantage and just doing straight pull ups is the most efficient method.\u00a0 I am going to keep trying off and on when I am in the climbing gym or climbing with friends to see if we can figure out a good method but for now it appears we have exhausted the options.\u00a0 I am hoping to try a new harness made my Petzl that is for rope access work that I think will make a huge difference.\u00a0 I am also back in the gym doing pull up after pull up and lifting weights so I can be in the best shape possible for climbing and skiing.</p><br /><p><a

The sadness comes from missing my second family of climbers and the beauty of Yosemite.</p><br /><p>I am amazed at the kindness of the climbing community. \u00a0When you are a climber it is like having a second family. \u00a0There are always people willing to help you meet your goals and to just be \u00a0a friend when needed. \u00a0I have many amazing memories to take with me from this trip from meeting famous climbers and being treated as a friend to spending lots of time at El Capitan bridge just hanging out and learning from the various climbers who spent time there. \u00a0I also spent time just watching deer in the water below the bridge and taking in the unbelievable scenery of the Valley. \u00a0I have a memory of the one night I spent in a tent in Camp 4 and it poured all night and using my rain coat to cover my wheelchair. \u00a0Thank god Sean O&#8217; Neill pushed me to buy that coat haha. \u00a0I would have had one wet day sitting in that chair the next day if not for that coat. \u00a0Also I don&#8217;t ever want to do that again if I can avoid it haha.I am also very grateful for Mash Alexander allowing me to stay with him in his tent/cabin for the other nights I was there. \u00a0That one night in the tent made me so much more grateful. \u00a0Skiy Detray, Ken Kreis, Adam Fisher, Maddy Pickering, Nathan Pacheco, Kiyoko Davis, Craig Muderlak, Nick Sullens, and Christian Cattell also were extremely integral to making my goal happen even if it did change. \u00a0They helped me train and helped me climb Astroman on &#8220;The Column&#8221;. \u00a0There is no way it would have happened if they were not a part of my life and I hope they all will be for many more climbs in the future. \u00a0There are also about 20 other people that I failed to get the names of who carried me for close to 2 hours into the base and then back out after the climb that deserve a huge thanks.</p><br /><p>Over time I started to become known to the people in the Valley and it felt like I had a second family. \u00a0I couldn&#8217;t go anywhere without someone saying &#8221; Hi Enock!&#8221;. \u00a0I will miss that about Yosemite. \u00a0Everyone is very friendly. \u00a0I also found friends that didn&#8217;t see me as the guy in the wheelchair but as another climber who needed direction and knowledge that could only be found by visiting the mecca of climbing. \u00a0I came away from this trip with a vastly different outlook on climbing and what is involved in undertaking an expedition such as climbing a big wall. \u00a0I am very grateful for the people that spoke up and said hey you need to do this and this before you do a big wall so lets try something else so we can figure things out. \u00a0Come back another time when you have it dialed in and that is exactly what I am doing. \u00a0I already have chosen some of the things I will need and in the near future will hopefully acquire everything for a possible ascent of Zodiac on &#8220;The Captain&#8221; in the spring if not then fall.</p><br /><p>There is one more thank you that needs to be said, I want to thank everyone on facebook and on this blog for the kind words of encouragement and comments that made me feel really great about what I am doing. \u00a0For those that felt I am inspirational to them I would like to encourage you to be inspired to get out and try something you have always wanted to because when you try something happens. \u00a0It may not be what you expected but if you keep trying you will reach whatever goal you set out to achieve. \u00a0So just think to yourself what do I most want to do in life and then set small goals to get there. \u00a0I would love to hear about anything you do try and anything I inspired you to do.</p><br /><p>Now that I am back home it is time to start training even harder and planning the next big thing. \u00a0It may be Zodiac or there may be something big before that. \u00a0It is now time to focus and get things done. \u00a0I will still be writing from time to time about my training and the events leading up to going back to Yosemite so please keep checking in and thank you for showing interest.</p><br /><p>In case you aren&#8217;t on my facebook page here are some of the pictures that Craig Muderlak has posted of our climb.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12063315_10207681211046727_7481239240684285288_n.jpg\"><img alt=\"12063315_10207681211046727_7481239240684285288_n\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-79\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12063315_10207681211046727_7481239240684285288_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12074809_10207665609416696_3420644055943060661_n.jpg\"><img alt=\"12074809_10207665609416696_3420644055943060661_n\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-80\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12074809_10207665609416696_3420644055943060661_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12105791_10207676700693971_8125499037106366220_n.jpg\"><img alt=\"12105791_10207676700693971_8125499037106366220_n\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-81\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12105791_10207676700693971_8125499037106366220_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" /></a> <a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12143103_10207667010851731_7553572052099536246_n.jpg\"><img alt=\"12143103_10207667010851731_7553572052099536246_n\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-82\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12143103_10207667010851731_7553572052099536246_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12088402_10207660601011489_7126846848005523026_n.jpg\"><img alt=\"12088402_10207660601011489_7126846848005523026_n\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-76\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12088402_10207660601011489_7126846848005523026_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" /></a></p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/78/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/78/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=gobeyondthefence.com&#038;blog=98641585&#038;post=78&#038;subd=gobeyondthefence&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" /></p>", "comment_count": 0, "trackback_enabled": false, "end_publication": null, "image": "", "status": 2, "tags": "dummy", "authors": [4], "password": "", "slug": "thank-you-just-isnt-enough", "categories": [], "comment_enabled": false}, "model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 9}, {"fields": {"content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "start_publication": null, "pingback_enabled": false, "excerpt": "When I came to Yosemite I had a specific goal in mind of climbing the Zodiac route on El Capitan.

Climbing is knowing terms of climbing, what ropes sizes mean, types of rope, how to tie all the knots needed.\u00a0 I knew some of the basics of most of these things but not enough to say I understood.\u00a0 Climbing is being able to organize a trip and have it ready before you even leave home so there is no confusion as to who has each role and who all the players are to make it happen.</p><br /><p>So I am sure you are wondering about the climb since that is what this whole thing has been about.\u00a0 We started up the Astroman Route on Washington Column Friday morning after getting up at 6:30 and having 15 people carry me for about 2 hours up to the base of the climb.\u00a0 It is pretty amazing how strangers come out of the woodwork to help out when it is needed around here.\u00a0 It may not happen to the last minute but it happens.\u00a0 We started up after the guys on my team, Nick Sullens, Christian Cattell, and Craig Muderlak all took part in fixing ropes and getting everything ready.\u00a0 I jugged (aka climbed) up the rope doing pull up after pull for about 8 hours or so until we reached the 3<sup>rd</sup> pitch at about 400 ft.\u00a0 That was our first day.\u00a0 The team then set up the portaledges and got the haul bags unpacked, which they had been hauling up each pitch all day.\u00a0 Each one weighed around 100 lbs. These guys put a serious amount of work into making this happen.\u00a0 That night we checked the weather forecast and realized there was a better than average chance of rain.\u00a0 We made the decision to end the climb a day early but not until we did one more pitch, just so I could get the feeling of climbing away from the portaledge.\u00a0 We ate supper which consisted of bagels, cheese, and salami and some lifesaver gummies.\u00a0 The view while we ate was amazing.\u00a0<a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1443831334702-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"1443831334702-1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-75\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1443831334702-1.jpg?w=198&#038;h=300\" width=\"198\" /></a> Half Dome was across from us and glowing.\u00a0\u00a0That line in the picture is a strap from the portaledge. While we ate and sat around we talked and everyone gave me advice on how to be a better climber. This is where the part that I needed came in. Now came the arduous task of trying to sleep in the cold 400 ft above the ground.\u00a0 Needless to say I didn\u2019t sleep much.\u00a0 I was not properly prepared for sleeping in that situation which is something else I need to work on for next time.\u00a0 What I lacked in sleep I made up for with an amazing view of Half Dome and the stars above.\u00a0 I have never seen the stars like that it was truly breathtaking and one of the reasons I climb.\u00a0 You will never get views like that any other way.\u00a0 The next morning we all woke up, got breakfast and then proceeded to wait for a few parties to climb past us. While waiting we met some really cool people one of them even knew a friend of mine who is a guide for Paradox Sports, Gary Dunn.\u00a0 They even volunteered to carry some of our stuff back to the trail at the end of our day.\u00a0 After the parties had passed if was time for me to start climbing and for some reason I wasn\u2019t into it.\u00a0 I think having sat on a ledge looking down to the Valley floor for so long had unnerved me a little.\u00a0 After a pep talk from Craig I decided to give it a go.\u00a0 Once I got going it felt amazing I pushed myself all the way to the anchor about 70 ft. or so.\u00a0 It was a pretty short last pitch.\u00a0 So after about 600 pull ups or so it was time to go back down.\u00a0 They lowered me to the ledge I had just left and then came the big lower.\u00a0 Nick was on rappel and I was being lowered.\u00a0 He was there to make sure I didn\u2019t crash into any major rock features and make sure everything went smoothly.\u00a0 He did an amazing job.\u00a0 We were lowered around 140 meters to the very bottom all on 2 ropes swinging in the breeze. It got a little scary when we got to the free hanging stretch where the wind caught us and we started to spin quite fast.\u00a0 That was probably the only time I was definitely nervous. Then of course everything that was brought up had to come down.\u00a0 That was the task of Craig and Christian.\u00a0 They had to rappel with 100 lb. bags hanging beneath them. It was pretty amazing to watch. They both did an amazing job throughout the whole process.\u00a0 When they got to the bottom and everything was on the ground they all then had the task of carrying everything to the trail.\u00a0 That I am sure was no easy task.\u00a0 I then had to wait at the base until I heard the cavalry coming to carry me out.\u00a0 It was not even confirmed that we even had anyone to carry out when they started lugging stuff to the trail so I was a bit worried.\u00a0 We came down a day early so no one expected to have to carry that day.\u00a0 I was greatly relieved to see so many awesome people some of them I had never met.\u00a0 They all just decided it would be a great thing to be a part of and volunteered.\u00a0\u00a0 The carry out was quite precarious and I am sure very tiring and stressful for the people carrying.\u00a0 The trail was very rocky with loose stuff everywhere and extremely steep but they all did an amazing job of being safe and secure.\u00a0 When they got me down the bottom I decided to invite everyone out for pizza and a few were able to come and we had an awesome time but we were clearly tired.\u00a0 That pretty much ended the climb and we got a ride home to finally have a good night\u2019s sleep. \u00a0So in the end you see I didn&#8217;t get the big wall experience I necessarily wanted I got the experience I needed to continue getting up to bigger and bigger walls in the future. I am sorry for the lack of pictures this time but there will be more to come as soon as Craig is able to get them to me.\u00a0 I will continue writing throughout my preparation for the next big wall and ski season so stay tuned.</p><br /><p>The Team:</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12088402_10207660601011489_7126846848005523026_n.jpg\"><img alt=\"12088402_10207660601011489_7126846848005523026_n\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-76\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/12088402_10207660601011489_7126846848005523026_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300\" width=\"300\" /></a></p><br /><p>Links of interest:</p><br /><p>Craig Muderlak Art: Muderlakart.com</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/73/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/73/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=gobeyondthefence.com&#038;blog=98641585&#038;post=73&#038;subd=gobeyondthefence&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" /></p>", "comment_count": 0, "trackback_enabled": false, "end_publication": null, "image": "", "status": 2, "tags": "dummy", "authors": [4], "password": "", "slug": "you-might-not-get-what-you-want-but-you-might-just-get-what-you-need", "categories": [], "comment_enabled": false}, "model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 10}, {"fields": {"content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "start_publication": null, "pingback_enabled": false, "excerpt": "The last few days have had their ups and downs while trying to plan a climb of The Prow on The Column.

Up until this afternoon I wasn\u2019t completely sure it would happen. Timmy O\u2019 Neill stepped in a couple days ago and for those of you that don\u2019t know Timmy he is a force to be reckoned with. He made it his mission to scour the Valley looking for people to help with my climb. We needed at least 5 people to help carry me to the base of the climb and all of our stuff like food and equipment that is needed. Timmy managed to find one person who actually wanted to climb with Timmy but then after hearing my story from Timmy decided to do this climb with me instead. Without the help of Timmy tracking down one person it was looking pretty grim.<br /><br />So today Christian Cantell volunteered to do whatever we needed to make this happen and he is now on the climbing team along with Craig Muderlak and Nick Sulens. He also tracked down all the people to carry the human cargo and non human cargo. Nathan Pacheco and Kiyoko Davis have been totally integral in making this happen. They helped me train and helped get people together and also gave me advice on what I should work on and what I truly needed to know to make this climb work for me and for the members of the team. I have truly learned a lot from both of them and owe them big time! Nathan will be manning the ground crew making sure we have people to carry our stuff and me to the base and back off the base. He will also make sure we have refreshments when we are done.<br /><br />It is truly amazing how many people it takes to pull this off and how many are coming together to make it happen. I will never be able to repay all the hard work and debt of gratitude I owe them.<br /><br />So we will be climbing The Prow on The Column (AKA Washington Column). We blast off for the base at 6:30 am and will do the first 3 pitches or maybe 4 tomorrow and then do the rest the next day then rappel down on the 3rd day possibly into the 4th day. We will be spending the 2 or 3 nights on portaledges that will be attached at master points on the rock. There we will be resting and eating our meals. I have never done this before so it should be an interesting and possibly scary experience.

I think the only thing we missed was the tourist tour of the whole valley.</p><br /><p>We went to Glacier Point and figured we would only be there at most an hour but it was so beautiful we ended up spending 3 hours.\u00a0 The road up was pretty scary in some sections but the view was worth it when we got there.\u00a0 We could see the whole Valley and even spotted the waterfalls which were actually flowing quite well.\u00a0 I am sure they are much more raging in the spring but still quite beautiful as they are right now. It is at an elevation of 7214 ft which made for some very distant views of the surrounding area.\u00a0 I strongly encourage anyone even if you aren\u2019t into climbing rocks to make it a priority to see this magical place.\u00a0 You will come away with a much deeper appreciation for what the world has to offer.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6764.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6764\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-67\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6764.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" /></a>View of waterfalls from Glacier Point</p><br /><p><img alt=\"R0010009[1]\" class=\" wp-image-69 alignleft\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/r00100091.jpg?w=396&#038;h=198\" width=\"396\" /></p><br /><p>We also went to\u00a0Mirror Lake which is a mile hike up a paved road.\u00a0 There is no longer any water there but it really resembled what I would expect the surface of the moon to look like.\u00a0 It had large boulders surrounded by sand and lots of interesting trails.\u00a0 There is also a cairn \u201cfield\u201d which is actually illegal in the park because it goes against the leave no trace policy by moving the rocks but it did make for an interesting find and actually was quite amazing to see.\u00a0 It was also quite accessible and easy to get around. This entire park is very well done as far as accessibility.\u00a0 It is by far the most accessible outdoor space I have ever been.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6757.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6757\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-68\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6757.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" /></a></p><br /><p>We also saw plenty of deer which Sandy and the kids were quite excited about.\u00a0 One even walked right in front of Tanner as if he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><br /><p>Even the time spent just hanging out in the hotel room was fun and enjoyable.\u00a0 The kids also loved the pools that were there. We took one day off just to enjoy that part of the experience and to see some of the local area where we were staying. We went to Coarsegold, CA and had lunch at a local diner with the nicest owners and really good food. It is called The Miners Grill if you are ever out this way.</p><br /><p>I think what I got out of this week was the fact that experiences aren\u2019t as fulfilling if you don\u2019t have people to share them with.\u00a0 It was so awesome to see the kids and Sandy\u2019s reactions to all the things I have loved seeing since being in the Valley and some of the things I had never experienced before as well.\u00a0 When they all left yesterday the kids were already talking about coming back.\u00a0 I am so grateful that I was able to have some part in giving them this experience in life and that I was able to share it with them.</p><br /><p>So starting today I am back in full training mode and hopefully will be up on a big wall by the 30<sup>th</sup> if the elected officials manage to shut down the government again.\u00a0 I will have to be on the wall before that happens or I won\u2019t be able to stay here anymore because no one will be getting paid to work here.\u00a0 I truly hope this doesn\u2019t happen but am preparing for the possibility given what I am seeing in the news.</p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/66/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/66/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=gobeyondthefence.com&#038;blog=98641585&#038;post=66&#038;subd=gobeyondthefence&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" /></p>", "comment_count": 0, "trackback_enabled": false, "end_publication": null, "image": "", "status": 2, "tags": "dummy", "authors": [4], "password": "", "slug": "shared-experiences", "categories": [], "comment_enabled": false}, "model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 12}, {"fields": {"content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "start_publication": null, "pingback_enabled": false, "excerpt": "As my first week is coming to an end I finally have time and internet access to give you all an update of what this experience has been like so far.I took eleven hours\u2019 worth of flights to get here and then a four hour bus ride from Fresno.

I had the most awesome bus driver ever.\u00a0 I was the only one on the bus so we got to talk at some of the stops where we had to wait 15 minutes or so.\u00a0 He let me pick out a\u00a0movie to watch about Yosemite and then stopped and bought me supper because I hadn\u2019t eaten since leaving Maine. I have ran into him three times since and he remembered my name and is always happy to see me.\u00a0 I hope when Sandy and the boys come out to visit they get to ride up here with him so I can introduce them.</p><br /><p>My first few days were spent just seeing the beauty of this incredible American treasure.\u00a0 I spent a lot of time at the El Cap Bridge where all the climbers AKA \u201cMonkeys\u201d hang out and watch and cheer on other climbers up on El Cap.\u00a0 This is one of the main reasons I love climbing.\u00a0 It is a huge community of awesome people who are willing to help each other achieve their dreams and goals.\u00a0 I learned so much just by sitting there and listening to the other climbers talk and through having conversations with them.\u00a0 I talked to Libby Sauter for a long time about the route I am going to be climbing and she explained each pitch and pointed out interesting parts of the climb so I could recognize where I would be climbing.\u00a0 Libby and Mayan Smith-Gobat are the current women\u2019s speed record holders for the Nose route on El Cap in a time of 5 hours and 39 minutes which actually beat their old record by 37 minutes.\u00a0 I have also been spending a lot of time with Mash Alexander who has many ascents of El Cap and actually lives in the park 2 months a year.\u00a0 He is not only a very accomplished and skilled climber but an amazing artist as well.\u00a0 I have had the help of another extremely accomplished and skilled climber, Skiy Detray.\u00a0 Skiy has over 30 ascents on El Cap but has also been all over the world climbing the Trango Towers in Pakistan in 22 days and numerous other missions.</p><br /><p>As I am sitting here writing this post I am doing some research on the people I\u2019ve met and spent time with and it\u2019s amazing the caliber of people that are so selfless and willing to help me complete my mission.</p><br /><p>This past week I attended a Paradox Sports event here in the valley and was able to spend time with and get to know a bunch of veterans of various branches of the military.\u00a0 Paradox does a September 11<sup>th</sup> hike up Half Dome every year for the past 3 years and it is an event centered on veterans and their experiences and disabilities.\u00a0 They also include civilians into the event and I and Vijay Viswanathan were the two civilian participants this year.\u00a0 We had the opportunity to do some training and climbing together and learn from each other about what works best for our situations.\u00a0 We did our training at Leconte Boulder and the base of the Nose on El Cap.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t necessarily make it as high on El Cap as I would have liked but I did learn that I needed to rework my systems and come up with something different for my ascent at the end of the month.\u00a0 Vijay really rocked it and made it about 600 ft to the sickle ledge.\u00a0 As I was waiting for him to complete his mission I rested at the bottom and met a lot of cool people who were just hiking the trail at the base.\u00a0 It seems like this place either attracts very friendly people or brings out the best in people.\u00a0 I took pictures with them and talked about my various adventure plans and gave them some of the basic knowledge I have of El Cap. One of them even recognized me from the Travel Channel which I never thought would happen.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6675.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6675\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6675.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0Vijay, Skiy, Adam, Ken and I at Leconte Boulder</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6673.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6673\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6673.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0An example of a climbing tentacle that Sean O&#8217; Neill developed. \u00a0I made this one.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6671.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6671\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-52\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6671.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0 Making the tentacle</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6672.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6672\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6672.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" width=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0Adam setting up the ropes with Skiy on belay</p><br /><p>So as my week is coming to a close I am excited for what is to come.\u00a0 I will be doing some different types of training this week for my ascent of El Cap.\u00a0 I have some new gadgets to try out that you will all see the results of when I am finished my ascent.\u00a0 I should have some amazing footage by the time I am done.\u00a0 I also hope to keep making connections with everyone and everything in this amazing place.\u00a0 This has truly been the trip of a lifetime and its barely even started.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6679.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSCF6679\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-54\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscf6679.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" /></a>\u00a0View of the Nose from the base</p><br /><p>Links of Interest:</p><br /><p>Skiy Detray:\u00a0http://www.mountaingazette.com/blogs/adapt-overcome-interview-skiy-detray/</p><br /><p>Libby Sauter:\u00a0http://www.climbing.com/news/new-womens-el-cap-speed-record-for-mayan-smith-gobat-and-libby-sauter/</p><br /><p>Paradox Sports: paradoxsports.org</p><br /><p>Zodiac Route of El Capitan:\u00a0http://www.supertopo.com/rock-climbing/Yosemite-Valley-El-Capitan-Zodiac</p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/49/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/49/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=gobeyondthefence.com&#038;blog=98641585&#038;post=49&#038;subd=gobeyondthefence&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" /></p>", "comment_count": 0, "trackback_enabled": false, "end_publication": null, "image": "", "status": 2, "tags": "dummy", "authors": [4], "password": "", "slug": "making-connections-with-people-el-cap-and-the-valley", "categories": [], "comment_enabled": false}, "model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 13}, {"fields": {"content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "start_publication": null, "pingback_enabled": false, "excerpt": "About a year ago Danika Gilbert, a grant writer and mountain guide who works with Paradox Sports, came to me with an idea to write a grant for something I wanted to do.

I started going over to Sean\u2019s every other week to do pull-ups on a rope in a tree.\u00a0 He has it set up so that when I get to the top anchor he can lower me back down and keep going until the rope runs out. We can then pull it back through and keep on going.\u00a0On the weeks when I didn&#8217;t go to Sean&#8217;s I was able to go to the New Balance fitness trail in Norway Maine. \u00a0It worked out really well that the fitness trail had a pull up bar just the right height to reach from my wheelchair and I was able to push laps on the trail to build endurance.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-42\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo-1.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300\" width=\"222\" /></a>\u00a0A shot of the rigging that allowed to me climb the tree<a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 2\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-43\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo-2.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300\" width=\"222\" /></a>\u00a0Seans belay harness</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo 3\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-44\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/photo-3.jpg?w=222&#038;h=300\" width=\"222\" /></a>\u00a0The T bar ascender I used to do pull ups</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/11777603_1145775245438631_2047049171_o.jpg\"><img alt=\"11777603_1145775245438631_2047049171_o\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-45\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/11777603_1145775245438631_2047049171_o.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" /></a>\u00a0Almost to the top about 32 feet up</p><br /><p>The first time I went to Sean\u2019s to do pull-ups it was a bit of a rude awakening as to how out of shape I was and how much work needed to be done.\u00a0 During my first trip up the rope my arms started to hurt, and I began to wonder if it was time to back out.\u00a0 As time went on and with each trip back up the rope, it actually got easier and faster. \u00a0 Over the next couple of months we went over the types of knots I should know and discussed a lot of what I would experience being on a big wall for days at a time.\u00a0 He gave me a wealth of knowledge that I really needed.\u00a0He also put me in contact with Henry Evans.</p><br /><p>Henry Evans became quadriplegic and mute after a stroke in 2003. He now uses robots to allow him to see the world from his home.\u00a0 He works with an organization called Robots for Humanity and through this organization is helping to develop the robots to allow himself and others to experience as much of the world as possible. I will be working with Henry to allow him to see the beauty of Yosemite and bring him along on my climbing adventures through the use of cameras and other technology.</p><br /><p>Another great contact that Sean gave me is Mash Alexander.\u00a0 He is a steward climber who lives, climbs, and works at Yosemite.\u00a0 He has been an absolutely integral part of planning this adventure I am undertaking.\u00a0 Without him, there is no way I could pull this off.\u00a0 He has put everything in place for me to stay and climb and gain all the experience possible while I am in the park.</p><br /><p>I will be leaving this Sunday for my trip and am nervous but very excited for all that I am about to experience.\u00a0 I am really appreciative of all the people it took to make this happen, and I hope I can do the trip justice through this blog.\u00a0 I want to make sure that you all can experience it with me and hopefully take something from it of your own.\u00a0 Maybe it will be to realize that there is nothing you can\u2019t do in this life if you truly want to, because the only thing holding you back is needing an idea and the ingenuity to find a solution to make it happen. Or maybe you will decide that you need to get out and see something you have never seen before. I hope to be able to post updates as often as I am on the ground, but the WiFi can be spotty in the park.</p><br /><p>Links of Interest:</p><br /><p>Danika Gilberts\u2019 recent expedition to Afghanistan to train and help a group of women summit some of the highest peaks in the region: \u00a0<a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2015/08/norfolk-nonprofit-starts-first-afghan-women-mountain-climbing-group\">http://hamptonroads.com/2015/08/norfolk-nonprofit-starts-first-afghan-women-mountain-climbing-group</a></p><br /><p>Henry Evans Ted Talk:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/henry_evans\">https://www.ted.com/speakers/henry_evans</a></p><br /><p>Robots for Humanity:\u00a0<a href=\"http://r4h.org/\">http://r4h.org/</a></p><br /><p>Sean O&#8217; Neill:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.climbing.com/news/a-first-paraplegic-lead-climbing-in-yosemite/\">http://www.climbing.com/news/a-first-paraplegic-lead-climbing-in-yosemite/</a></p><br /><p>Challenged Athletes Foundation:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.challengedathletes.org/\">http://www.challengedathletes.org/</a></p><br /><p>AAC Live Your Dream Grant:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.americanalpineclub.org/\">https://www.americanalpineclub.org/</a></p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/41/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gobeyondthefence.wordpress.com/41/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=gobeyondthefence.com&#038;blog=98641585&#038;post=41&#038;subd=gobeyondthefence&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" /></p>", "comment_count": 0, "trackback_enabled": false, "end_publication": null, "image": "", "status": 2, "tags": "dummy", "authors": [4], "password": "", "slug": "preparing-for-yosemite", "categories": [], "comment_enabled": false}, "model": "zinnia.entry", "pk": 14}, {"fields": {"content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "start_publication": null, "pingback_enabled": false, "excerpt": "I should probably start with some background about me.

Ed. teacher Bob Dyer. \u00a0He was the first person to really push me to go beyond the fence and test my limits. \u00a0I remember the first day I met him one of the first things he said to me was how many push ups can you do. \u00a0He suggested 20 so I did 40. \u00a0I think that was my first mistake and also the best thing I could have done. \u00a0I set the bar a little too high and he expected that from me from then on out. \u00a0He made sure I was involved in as many things as possible even taking a week each year to take me skiing at <a href=\"http://maineadaptive.org\">Maine Adaptive Sports and Recreation.</a></p><br /><p>It was definitely Mr. Dyer that \u00a0started me on \u00a0a life of adventure. \u00a0About 5 years ago when I would see a friend of mine, Nick Hall, post pictures of his adventures online I started to think about the possibilities of bigger adventures. \u00a0He was a ranger at Mt. Rainier and unfortunately lost his life\u00a0while performing his duties during a rescue mission. \u00a0It was after this tragic moment that I decided I wanted to try to find a way to be able to witness the views he had seen atop Rainier for myself.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/nick.jpg\"><img alt=\"Nick\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-25\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/nick.jpg?w=300&#038;h=230\" width=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0\u00a0Nick Hall</p><br /><p>I knew that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wellman\">Mark Wellman\u00a0</a>\u00a0had been the first paraplegic to climb El Capitan in 1989 but I hadn&#8217;t seen much about climbing since reading about his attempt. \u00a0I decided to do some research and found an organization called <a href=\"http://paradoxsports.org\">Paradox Sports</a>. Paradox Sports is an organization that allows people of all abilities to be able to rock and ice climb among other sports. \u00a0I noticed they were doing a rock climbing event in the Shawagunk Mountains that October and I signed up.</p><br /><p>During the Gunks event I met a bunch of amazing like minded adventuresome people whose only mission was to make it possible for other people to enjoy adventure too. \u00a0I immediately knew this was the group for me. I was able to learn a lot of techniques for sit climbing that weekend from Sean O&#8217; Neill, an accomplished sit climber, who is now a great friend. I also gained a wealth of knowledge from the other able bodied guides who helped put on the event including Nate McKenzie and Gary Dunn. They both continue to push and inspire me to greater endeavors. I found out that weekend that Sean\u00a0lived an hour from me and have been learning from him ever since. I have been back to the Gunks for this event the last 3 years and will be attending again this year. \u00a0If anyone else would like to attend this is where to register:</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://fs22.formsite.com/paradoxsports/Gunks/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fs22.formsite.com/paradoxsports/Gunks/index.html</a></p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_9129.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_9129\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-26\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_9129.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200\" width=\"300\" /></a>\u00a0Sean giving me advice</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lourdesirizarry-3066.jpg\"><img alt=\"LourdesIrizarry-3066\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lourdesirizarry-3066.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300\" width=\"199\" /></a>\u00a0Nate McKenzie helping with some ice climbing</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lourdesirizarry-3513.jpg\"><img alt=\"LourdesIrizarry-3513\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-30\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lourdesirizarry-3513.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199\" width=\"300\" /></a></p><br /><p>Eriq Powers, Nate McKenzie, and Gary Dunn</p><br /><p>I have done one other climb with the help of Nate McKenzie, Betsy Smith and Alan Kline. \u00a0They enabled me to climb Book of Solemnity route on Cathedral Ledge in North Conway, NH by setting ropes and managing all the safety for me while I did pull up after pull up. \u00a0It took most of the day but I eventually reached the top of my first multi pitch climb.</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/hanging.jpg\"><img alt=\"hanging\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-31\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/hanging.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" /></a></p><br /><p>Cathedral Ledge</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/summit.jpg\"><img alt=\"summit\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-32\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://gobeyondthefence.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/summit.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300\" width=\"225\" /></a></p><br /><p>Cathedral Ledge Summit</p><br /><p>I think it was that climb that really sealed my passion for the challenge of rock climbing.
