<h2>Mission</h2>

To help connect people by making it easier to provide, find, organize and share views of the world.

&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;<p>
This involves providing access to technologies that allow us to see other parts of the world,
and to share our own, in many exciting ways, such as live or recorded images, video, and virtual
models.   More importantly, it involves using those technologies to help us connect, and to share
our stories, concerns and dreams and aspirations.
